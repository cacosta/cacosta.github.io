I don't like ***Hot Corners***. Yeah, I said it. Hot Corners are a feature on Apple computers that allow you to link a particular system feature to a corner of your screen so all you have to do is drag or track your pointer to initiate that feature, such as a screen saver, show desktop, etc. I find Hot Corners annoying because more often than not, my pointer sporadically finds its way to these corners when I least expect them to, for example during a presentation or when a fellow developer wants to hop into the driver's seat on my laptop, accidentally setting off a dizzying leap into the subjective layers that make up my own "MacOSX Sys Pref Universe".

What I do like are [Keyboard Shortcuts](http://www.danrodney.com/mac/). Quick, efficient, and sexy, keyboard shortcuts allow you to seamlessly utilize features of your computer with the stroke of a key (or two or sometimes three) but once you have them locked into memory, utilizing a computer's feature is literally at your fingertips.

Ah, the good 'ol trusty screen saver. Having the ability to quickly lock and start your screen saver is a very important security feature every computer user should adopt, especially if they work at a company where you deal with sensitive content. Don't depend on your screen saver coming up 15-20 min after you leave it idle as a form of prevention from your personal information being accessible by anyone. Lock it. And I mean lock it good.

Let's take a look at a couple of ways you can access your locked screen saver quickly and efficiently:

###<i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> First, lock your Screen Saver

#### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> **How?**
* Click on the <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> symbol in the upper left corner of you computer screen and select *System Preferences* from the drop down menu.
  
  ![System Preferences](/assets/macosx-sys-pref.png "System Preferences")

* Select the *Security & Privacy* icon under the *Personal* section of System Preferences.

* Make sure "Require password *immediately* after sleep or screen saver begins" is checked.

###<i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> Next, create an easy shortcut to start your Sreen Saver

#### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> **How?**
* Open the **Automator** application located inside the **Applications** folder

  ![Automator App - Service](/assets/app-automator.png "Automator App - Service")

* Choose the **Service** icon

  ![Automator App - Service](/assets/app-automator-service.png "Automator App - Service")

* In the search bar located in the upper left of the application, type in a search for *Start Screen Saver*. Click on the **Start Screen Saver** option once it shows up in the results list just below it.

  ![Automator App - Search](/assets/app-automator-search.png "Automator App - Search")

* Drag the *Start Screen Saver* option over to the larger window to the right. This will add it as a property of the automated service you are creating. Make sure the service drop-down selections are exactly as you see them in this example.

   ![Automator App - Drag](/assets/app-automator-drag.png "Automator App - Drag")

* In the application menubar under **File**, select **Save** and give your new Service a name, something like "Start Screen Saver". Once your service is saved, close out of the Automator application.
* Click on the <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> symbol in the upper left corner of you computer screen and select *System Preferences* from the drop down menu.
* Select the **Keyboard** icon located in the **Hardware** section. 
* Click on the **Services** gear icon in the left menu box, then in the right menu box scroll down towards the end until you get to the **General** category. You should see an option for the new service you created. Enable it by checking the box and then double-click to the right of the option to add/record a shortcut. I liked to use **&#94;&#8984;S** since its easy to remember and does not conflict with any other shortcuts when you are accessing system features.

  Vo√≠la! Now you should be able to access your locked screen saver by using your shortcut key.


###<i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> Alternate option: add the lock icon to your menubar

#### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> **How?**

* Open the **Keychain Access.app** located in **Aplications** <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> **Utilities**

  ![Kechain Access](/assets/app-keychain-access.png "Keychain Access")

* In the top menubar, under **Keychain Access** drop down, select **Preferences**.

  ![Kechain Access - Preferences](/assets/app-keychain-access-pref.png "Keychain Access - Preferences")

* Enable the option **show keychain status in menubar** and close this window. Close out of the Keychain Access app.

  ![Kechain Access - Enable](/assets/app-keychain-access-enable.png "Keychain Access - Enable")

* Now you should see a lock icon in your top menubar. Click on this icon and it should activate your locked screen saver.

  There you have it. Easy Access to your screen saver, locked and secure. Happy computing!
