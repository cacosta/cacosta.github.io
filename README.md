### About Me

I loved to code the minute I made a turtle move across the screen with GOTO statements in the 7th grade. Without any female role models to encourage me to focus on computers, my love of code remained dormant while I went on to pursue a professional career in Dance and Musical Theater. I eventually returned to my love of technology and pursued a B.S. in Computer Science in 2003. I have since developed a career in Web Development spanning over 10 years and currently part of an innovative and creative team at The New York Times.

I have a desire to inspire and encourage women of all ages and backgrounds to pursue technology with the hope of closing the gender gap that exists in STEM occupations and education which led me to become a teacher and member of the Leadership Team at Girl Develop It, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that teaches and encourages women to learn technology one line of code at a time. In addition, I am passionate about developing technology in collaboration with artists that promotes social and cultural change, lending my skills on open source projects with organizations such as [Code for America]("http://www.codeforamerica.org/).

When I'm not coding, you can find me dabbling in [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/corina_acosta/sets/), teaching, dancing, tinkering, or bending myself into a pretzel on a yoga mat.
