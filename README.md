###My Personal Website

My first time deploying to Github Pages.

* For quick edits and new posts, I am making use of [Prose.io](https://github.com/prose/prose) by Prose
  * TO DO: Try utilizing the open-source Prose codebase on my own local server using [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server) by Nodejitsu. I want the ease of using this tool locally before pushing up my changes to Github Pages.
* I made gh-pages my default repo and deleted master to avoid branch confusion and since this is a personal site master is not neccessary. I create branches separately for new features or hotfixes, merge those into gh-pages, and push. Much better and efficient workflow.
